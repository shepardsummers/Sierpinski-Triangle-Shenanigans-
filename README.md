# What is Sierpinski Triangle

A Sierpinski Triangle (at least the sierpinski triangle this program is for) is a geometry that occurs after drawing the largest circle possible withing a triangle, then repeating this process (see image below since I know this isnt a great explanation)

The radius of circles can be represented as the sequence as follows:

Where r is the largest circles radius

The first 3 terms of the sequence would be: {r, r/k, r/(k^2)...} 

# How to Use Program

You will be prompted to select 4 different options:

1: kToAngle - This converts a k value into an angle 

2: angleToK - This converts an angle into a k value

3: check - this checks the program for accuracy

4: exit - this stops the program

# Math Part

Through some math (which I have attached as a pdf to this repo) we find that the k value is proportional to the angle and follows this equation:

and subsequently
